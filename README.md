### How This Repo is Organized

This repository is organized by class number and homework task. Each folder is named according to the class and task number, and it contains the required files, code, and documentation for each assignment.

```
ðŸ“‚ Class-19/
   â””â”€â”€ homework-1/
       â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
       â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
       â””â”€â”€ script.js
ðŸ“‚ Class-20/
   â””â”€â”€ homework-2/
       â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
       â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
       â””â”€â”€ package.json
ðŸ“‚ Class-21/
   â””â”€â”€ homework-3/
       â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
       â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
       â””â”€â”€ script.js
```

Each homework will have its own folder with the corresponding class number to make it easier to find and navigate.

### Disclaimer

These are my implementations of the 100Devs homework assignments, and while I've put my best effort into them, they may be far from perfectâ€”in fact, theyâ€™re probably terrible! But weâ€™re all learning, right? ðŸ˜…

Iâ€™m always open to feedback on anything I do, so please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. If you spot something that could be improved or have suggestions, let me know. I would love to make a friend along the way! Letâ€™s learn and grow together. ðŸ˜Š
